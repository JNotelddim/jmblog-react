# JM Blog React

This repository contains the React (front-end) code for a simple CRUD
web app I built to for blogging. It's super simple, and not at all polished or
perfected yet. I just wanted something to work on gradually when I have slow
times on projects at work, or free L&D cycles.

If you want, you can sign up for an account and author your posts on this blog.
(Not sure why, you'd want to do that... but hey, whatever floats your boat!)

I intend to add some pagination and filtering to the main list page once I've
written a couple more posts. So that'd make it a little cleaner if other people
did want to participate for some reason :P

## Deployment

I've currently just got this repo deployed with netlify. I own a domain which I
intend to use for this blog, but I just haven't set up the DNS records for that
just yet.

## Running a local version

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
So, if you want, you can clone down this code and run it with

`yarn start`

It won't do much for you if you don't have it connect to either the production
API, or a local version of the api. If you want to get a local version of the API
running, please see [the jmblog-api repository](https://github.com/JNotelddim/jmblog-api).
